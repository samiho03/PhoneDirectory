##  Data Structures Used

- **ArrayList<Contact>**:
  - All contact records are stored in an `ArrayList` called `contactList`.
  - Enables efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of records.

- **HashMap for temporary mappings** *(optional in some functions)*:
  - Used internally to handle key-value data temporarily during sorting or searching.

##  Logic Highlights

- **Model Class (`Contact.java`)**:
  - Stores contact attributes.
  - Getters and setters manage data encapsulation.

- **Sorting Logic**:
  - `Collections.sort(contactList, Comparator)` sorts by name or company.
  - Sorting triggered through dropdown or UI buttons.

- **Search Logic**:
  - Implements keyword-based search by iterating through the `ArrayList`.
